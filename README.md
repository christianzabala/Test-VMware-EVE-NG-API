# A Simple python script to run VMware Workstation and EVE-NG using their API

NOTE: Scripts are not yet clean and might still have errors, since I'm still working on it. Script is not tested on the paid versions of VMware player and EVE-NG Pro.

The scripts on this repository is not that good so if you are looking for a more clean and better scripts for VMware and EVE-NG, might as well check the other ones. Since I wrote this scripts to help me learn more and improved my python skills and at the same time help me automate starting up my labs on EVE-NG

My end goal is to complete some To do comments on the scripts and combine the 2 scripts for me to just execute just 1 script.
